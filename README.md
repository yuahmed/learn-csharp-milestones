	- [x] ‚úèÔ∏è Q: Will a [collision detection](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CollidersOverview.html) occur when a Kinematic Rigidbody Collider touches a Static Collider? : **No, a collision detection does not occurr in this case. A kinematice rigidbody collider can send a trigger message upon collision with a static collider.**
	- [x] Use `OnCollisionEnter()` to check if a game object has run into another collider
	- [x] Use `Destroy()` to remove a game object from the scene
	- [x] Use `OnTriggerEnter()` and `OnTriggerExit()` to detect when two colliders start and stop touching

- Character Control
	- [ ] Capture keyboard input in C# using the `enum` type and value `KeyCode.Space`
	- [x] Use `AddForce()` to make a character jump

	- [x] Add a win condition to the game and display it in the UI
	- [x] Use `Time.timeScale = 0` to pause the game
